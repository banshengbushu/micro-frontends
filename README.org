* What's the problem now
** Monolith project
   - Innovation in legacy code base
   - Huge team working on same product
   - Only refactor part of the page and do the integration
   - Microservice backend but a monolith frontend
** TW Tech Radia
   - Nov 2016, Assess
   - Nov 2017, Trial
   - Apr 2019, Adopt
** Definition
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   "An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole"
 #+END_QUOTE
* Pros of micro frontends
  - Smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
  - More scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams
  - The ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible
** Incremental upgrades
   - Instead of rewrite the whole application
   - Refactor piece by piece
** Simple, decoupled codebases
   - Smaller code base is easy to work with
   - Force to decouple the logic between parts application
   - Sharing domain models across bounded contexts becomes more difficult
** Independent deployment
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends/deployment.png">
** Independent deployment
   - Each micro frontend should have its own continuous delivery pipeline
   - It shouldn't matter if the old monolith is on a fixed, manual, quarterly release cycle
   - Independent release cycles
** Autonomous teams
   - Teams can have full ownership of everything they need
   - Move quickly and effectively
** Autonomous teams

* How to meet the new pattern Micro Frontends
** Different Patterns
*** URL jump
*** Server Side Componsition
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    <esi:include src='/include/navigation/>
    #+END_SRC
    - Page cahcing issue
* Free Lunch?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are no free lunches when it comes to software architecture - everything comes with a cost.
